We have 2 tables in a relational database:
    • Clients (client_id(PK), client_name)
    • Orders (order_id(PK), client_id, order_sum, order_date)

Please write the following SQL queries:
  a- list of clients, which have an order with order_sum > 50

  SELECT *
  FROM Clients
  WHERE client_id IN (SELECT DISTINCT client_id FROM Orders WHERE order_sum > 50);

  b- clients, whose total sum of orders exceeds 100

   SELECT *
   FROM Clients
   WHERE client_id IN (SELECT client_id FROM Orders GROUP BY client_id HAVING SUM(order_sum) > 100);
